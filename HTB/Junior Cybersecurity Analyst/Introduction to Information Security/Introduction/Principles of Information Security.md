- **Confidenciality** : Information is accessible to authorized people/apps (encription and acces controls)
- **Integrity** : accuracy and completeness of data, no unauthorized modifications (hashing and digital signatures)
- **Availability** : Information accesible to authorized users when they need it (redundancy and disaster recovery plan)
- **Non-repudiation**: A party cannot deny the authenticity of their signature (digital signature and audit logs) "ex: if you sign a contract you cannot say that you didn't"
- **Authentification**: Verify the identity of a user, process or device, crucial for confidenciality (passwords, biometrics, multi-factor auth)
- **Privacy**: Proper handling of sensitive data, compliance for data protection regulations (data minimization and consent managment)

### Process of InfoSec

Proccesses that provides a company data and information security. This protects the CIA (the principles, not the organization).

Risk Assessment --> Security Planning --> Implementation of Security Controls --> Monitoring and Detection -- > Incident Response --> Disaster Recovery --> Continuous Improvement

### Purpose of InfoSec

- Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access
- Ensuring business continuity
- Maintaining regulatory compliance
- Preserving brand reputation
- Safeguarding intellectual property
- Enabling secure digital transformation

### Tools in InfoSec

- `Firewalls`: Control incoming and outgoing network traffic
- `Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)`: Monitor for and block suspicious activities
- `Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems`: Collect and analyze security event data
- `Vulnerability scanners`: Identify potential weaknesses in systems and applications
- `Penetration testing tools`: Simulate attacks to find vulnerabilities (e.g., Metasploit, Burp Suite)
- `Encryption tools`: Protect data confidentiality and integrity
- `Access control systems`: Manage user permissions and authentication
- `Security awareness training platforms`: Educate users about security best practices
