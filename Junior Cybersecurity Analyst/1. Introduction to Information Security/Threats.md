## DDoS

 Interrupt the normal functioning of a website, server, or online service by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic.
 
- DoS: attack from a single source
- DDoS: from multiple sources, often compromised computers with malware (botnet)

1. Attacker: sends instructions to the botnet
2. Botnet: infested deviced, servers or IoT
3. Victim

## Ransomware

malicious software (or malware) that infiltrates servers, computers, and networks, encrypting valuable files so they become inaccessible. --> then demand a ransom payment, for a decryption key

Disrupt:
- services
- erode trust
- damage reputations
- ...

Phishing --> download ransomware --> encrypt files --> ransom message and deadline


## Social Engineering

psychological manipulation, take advantage of human nature.

5 Fundamental Techniques

- `Phishing`: Attackers send deceptive emails or messages that appear to come from legitimate sources to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information.
- `Pretexting`: creating a fabricated scenario (a pretext) to engage the target and extract information or persuade them to perform an action.
- `Baiting`: Uses the promise of something enticing to lure victims into a trap. Ex: USB 
- `Tailgating`: Attacker following an authorized person into a restricted area without proper credentials.
- `Quid Pro Quo`: attacks offer a benefit in exchange for information or access. Ex: Upgrade software plan.

## Insider Threat

People inside the organization. These insiders misuse their access privileges to harm the organization, either intentionally or unintentionally.

- `Malicious Insiders`:  steal sensitive information, sabotage systems, or commit fraud for personal gain, revenge, or to benefit another organization
- `Negligent Insiders`: an employee might accidentally send confidential information to the wrong email address or fall for a phishing scam that compromises security.
- `Compromised Insiders`: HAckers that operate within the organization's systems as if they were legitimate through hacked credentials or other methods.

acces --> investigate --> plan --> execute --> clean proves 


## Advanced Persistance Threat APT

 long-term operations that require significant resources and planning
 
APT ATTACK FLOW
1. Recon → attackers study the target.
2. Infiltration → phishing/exploits to get in.
3. Foothold → malware + backdoors.
4. Lateral movement → escalate + spread.
5. Data exfiltration → steal info quietly.
6. Persistence → stay hidden long-term.
